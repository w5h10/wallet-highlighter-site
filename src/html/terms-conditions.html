          European Centre of Arbitration having its seat in Strasbourg, and which are in force at the time the

          Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no

          piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision
          is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within
          that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a
          court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to
          submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.<br><br>17. CORRECTIONS<br><br>There may be information on
